Hi! My name is Esteban Puyana, I am a third-year student at Northeastern University pursuing a double B.S. in Computer Science & Philosophy. 

During my time at Northeastern, I have excelled in a variety of challenging courses such as:
1. Fundamentals of CS I & II
2. Fundamentals of DS
3. Algorithms, Data & Theory
4. Object-Oriented Programming
5. Discrete Mathematics & Data Structures
6. Calculus for Engineering
7. Mathematical Reasoning

I am interested in software & data engineering, and most of the work I have done has been with Python, Java, Kotlin, and SQL. 

From August through December of 2024, I completed my first Co-Op as a Data Architecture Engineer for the largest South/Central American hotel management firm, GHL.
At GHL I worked in data centralization and automation systems, helping the corporate office standardize their data management procedures. This Co-Op experience allowed me to 
deepen my experience with Python and SQL, and I gained additional experience working with Airflow and C# .NET development. 

The repositories on my profile contain a mix of personal and school projects, and I hope they provide some insight into the work I have done my skills, and my interests.
